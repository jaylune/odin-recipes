# Title: **Recipes Project**
## Summary:
*A small project to demonstrate understanding of basic HTML (multiple pages, boilerplate, lists, images) and practice use of Git.*

## Reflection:
Learned about the importance of syntax and how easy it is to forget the smaller details (such as linking!) Also how difficult it can be to scale content even when it's fairly similar in shape/format because it's such a repetitive process doing so with only HTML.
