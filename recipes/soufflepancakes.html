                <li>Large Eggs</li>
                <li>Cake Flour</li>
                <li>Whole Milk</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>Baking Powder</li>
                <li>Neutral Oil</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Confectioners' Sugar</li>
                <li>Maple Syrup</li>
                <li>Fresh Fruits</li>
                <li>Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Equipment</h3>
                <li>Hand Mixer or Stand Mixer with Balloon Whisk</li>
                <li>Hand Whisk</li>
                <li>Nonstick Frying Pan with Lid</li>
                <li>Offset Spatula</li>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the batter: Separate the egg whites and yolks into two bowls and put the whites in the freezer for 15 minutes. Whisk the yolks, milk, and vanilla extract with a mixer until thick and frothy. Sift the flour and baking powder into the liquid mixture and whisk by hand to combine; do not overmix.</li>
                <li>Make the meringue and preheat the pan: Beat the half-frozen egg whites until frothy and opaque. Gradually add the sugar while beating at high speed until stiff peaks form. Look for meringue that holds a peak and has a tip that folds over. Start preheating a large, nonstick frying pan to 300ºF (150ºC) on the lowest heat and lightly grease it with oil.</li>
                <li>Gently fold the meringe into the batter by hand: Use a hand whisk to fold in the whipped egg whites, one-third at a time. Gently incorporate without breaking the air bubbles. Mix until well combined and homogeneous.</li>
                <li>Stack three scoops of batter for each pancake: Keep your preheated frying pan at 300ºF (150ºC) over low heat at all times. For the first pancake, place one small scoop of batter in the pan in a tall mound. Then, stack a second scoop on top. Repeat to make the other two pancakes. Then, mound a third scoop onto each, keeping the batter piled high.</li>
                <li>Add water, cover, and set a timer for 6-7 minutes: A splash of water in the pan creates steam and covering with a lid locks in the moisture. After 2 minutes, add a final scoop of batter to each pancake. Cover and keep cooking.</li>
                <li>Flip over, add more water, and cover to finish cooking: When the timer goes off, use an offset spatula to very gently flip the pancakes with a “rolling over” motion. Add another splash of water and cover the pan. Set the timer for 4–5 minutes and cook until the other side is nicely browned.</li>
                <li>Serve as desired! Add confectioners' sugar, drizzle maple syrup, surround with fruit, etc.</li>
